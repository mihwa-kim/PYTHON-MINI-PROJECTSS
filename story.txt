Once upon a time, in a land far away, there was a <adjective> <noun> named <name>. Every day, <name> would wake up, put on their <adjective> <piece of clothing>, and head out to <verb> in the <place>.

One day, while <verb>ing, <name> stumbled upon a <adjective> <noun>. It was unlike anything they had ever seen. Curious, <name> picked it up and suddenly, a <adjective> <creature> appeared.

"Greetings, <name>," said the <creature>. "I am here to grant you three <plural noun>."

<name> was amazed and thought carefully about their wishes. First, they wished for <something you wish for>. Instantly, it appeared before them. Next, they wished for <another wish>. Again, it came true. Finally, <name> wished for <a third wish>.

The <creature> smiled and said, "Your wishes have been granted. Use them wisely."

From that day on, <name> lived a <adjective> life, always remembering the day they met the <creature> in the <place>.

The End.
